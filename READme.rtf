# Correlation Between Extreme Indices and Fluxes\
\
This repository contains the code and analysis for my research conducted at the UFZ Helmholtz during the summer of 2022 and 2023. \
\
## Project Overview\
\
During the summer of 2022, I focused on cleaning and analyzing remote sensing data to map correlations in Germany between air/soil temperature extremes and various heat fluxes on Earth's surface. The aim was to better understand the relationships between temperature extremes and the energy exchange processes occurring in the environment.\
\
The following summer, I extended this work by training a machine learning (ML) model using the cleaned data. The goal of the model was to predict latent heat flux (LHF), which plays a critical role in understanding climate dynamics and the Earth's energy budget.\
\
## Repository Contents\
\
- `Correlation Between Extreme Indices and Fluxes (cartopy).ipynb`: This Jupyter notebook contains the code used to clean the remote sensing data and analyze the correlations between extreme indices and various heat fluxes.\
- `LHF model (1).ipynb`: This notebook includes the code used to train and evaluate the machine learning model for predicting latent heat flux.\
\
## Dependencies\
\
- Python 3.x\
- Required Python packages: numpy, pandas, scikit-learn, cartopy, etc. (specific versions are listed within the notebooks)\
- Jupyter Notebook or Jupyter Lab for running the `.ipynb` files\
